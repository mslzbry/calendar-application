# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description:

For this project, I was instructed to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. My goal is to address the above points, along with proper deployment, and application and repo quality.

To start, I explored this weekâ€™s in-class activities and reviewed/built the starter html, css, and JavaScript on the points we learned throughout the week. The above was based around the conditionals/requirements provided in this week's module.

Moving beyond this, I then built out the html such that each block of time has a respective section of code. Then, in JavaScript I worked on the save button and time component of the site. After this, I tested the site several times, answering all possible options to find any edge cases.

My primary goals throughout the above processes include: when the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar; when scrolling down, timeblocks for standard business hours are displayed; each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future; when a timeblock is clicked, the user can enter text and save (text for this is then saved in local storage); when the page is refreshed, saved input remains.

Throughout this entire process, I added relevant comments in the JavaScript; these comments act as snippets of the general outline of the content herein.
